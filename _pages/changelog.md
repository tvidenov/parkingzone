Here you can keep a changelog for your app. Edit the markdown based CHANGELOG.md which is located in the _pages directory. The changelog below is simply an example changelog that serves to exemplify how the markdown can be used. You can be as creative as you want with the markdown.

### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
This is the first version of the app which is at the moment pretty basic but I am planning on adding more features to it.
Currently the app is available in Bulgarian and English.
Some of the features are: 
- paying for paid parking zones in Sofia, Burgas, Varna and Plovdiv
- reminders for expiring zone
- information about how much are you allowed to stay in a zone
- widget for even faster payment
- save as many cars as you need and keep them in one place
