# **Version 1.0**
This is the first version of the app which is at the moment pretty basic but I am planning on adding more features to it.
Currently the app is available in Bulgarian and English.
Some of the features are: 
- paying for paid parking zones in Sofia, Burgas, Varna and Plovdiv
- reminders for expiring zone
- information about how much are you allowed to stay in a zone
- widget for even faster payment
- save as many cars as you need and keep them in one place
